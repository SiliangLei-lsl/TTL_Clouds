# TTL_Clouds
The data is for tropical tropopause layer (TTL) clouds properties, concluding four main parts:
(1). Spatial distribution of TTL clouds for annual, winter, spring, summer and fall;
(2). Month mean height and temperature of cloud top and tropopause; mean profile numbers per uint, ratio and cloud top/base for deep convective clouds(DCC), anvil and cirrus;
(3). Heating rate and vertical velocity for different types;
(4). Heating rate and vertical velocity for cloud, clear, and cloud-induced.
